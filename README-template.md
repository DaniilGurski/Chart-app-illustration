## My process

### Built with

- SASS / SCSS
- [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) - Task manager
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This is my first project using SCSS and task manager. The development seemed a bit unusual because of the tons of posobilites that SASS provides and the ability to organize styles in different files. I mostly practiced using mixins, nesting, and extensions. Variables within the root were generated using for and map loops, which was also a bit unusual. To organize everything I tried using [7-1 folder structure](https://gist.github.com/rveitch/84cea9650092119527bc) and became more familiar with it. Comilation of SASS was handled by gulp task manager.
